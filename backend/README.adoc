The algorithm tries to filter the trends of r/wallstreetbets.  
The following steps are performed:  
- read 100 hot headlines & texts
- remove words that appear in a standard word list
- run against a blacklist and delete all found words (YOLO, FOMO, DD, etc.)
- delete single letters
- remove duplicate words

## TODO:
- [x] logic which filters the most mentioned stock symbols from a text
- [x] scan reddit posts of the last day (headlines)
- [ ] scan comments of the reddit posts
- [ ] exclude users with karma below 50 to exclude bots
- [ ] provide private API access
